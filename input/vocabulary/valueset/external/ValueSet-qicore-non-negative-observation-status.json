Additional information such &quot;released&quot;, &quot;signed&quot;, etc would be represented using [Provenance](provenance.html) which provides not only the act but also the actors and dates and other related data. These act states would be associated with an observation status of `preliminary` until they are all completed and then a status of `final` would be applied.</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/codesystem-observation-status.html#observation-status-amended\">amended</a></td><td>Amended</td><td>Subsequent to being Final, the observation has been modified subsequent.

This electronic record should never have existed, though it is possible that real-world decisions were based on it. (If real-world activity has occurred, the status should be &quot;cancelled&quot; rather than &quot;entered-in-error&quot;.).</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/codesystem-observation-status.html#observation-status-unknown\">unknown</a></td><td>Unknown</td><td>The authoring/source system does not know which of the status values currently applies for this observation. Note: This concept is not to be used for &quot;other&quot; - one of the listed statuses is presumed to apply, but the authoring/source system does not know which.</td></tr></table></li></ul></div>"
